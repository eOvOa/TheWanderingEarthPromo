	<br> When the sun dies out, the people of Earth build giant thrusters to move the planet out of orbit and sail to a new star system. After 2,500 years, young people continue the fight for everyone's survival.

	<br>
	<br> In 2058, the aging Sun is about to turn into a red giant and threatens to engulf the Earth's orbit within 100 years, forcing nations to consolidate into the United Earth Government (UEG). The Wandering Earth Project to migrate the Earth out of the Solar System and into the Alpha Centauri system is initiated and uses 12,000 enormous fusion-powered Earth Engines built across the Northern Hemisphere with further Torque Engines along the equator to propel the entirety of planet Earth. Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang oversees the gravitational slingshot maneuver of Earth using the gravity of Jupiter to assist propulsion before going on his mission to the Navigation Platform International Space Station to help navigate the Earth along its interstellar journey.
